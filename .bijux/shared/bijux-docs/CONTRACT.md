# Bijux documentation shell contract

Bijux extends the admitted MkDocs Material theme. MkDocs renders product content,
navigation, plugin output, and templates; Material retains its search worker,
ranking, content enhancements, and document stream. Bijux owns the shared
navigation shell, palette persistence, diagram renderer, and bounded integration
adapters. Product repositories own identity and authored content.

`config/mkdocs-baseline.json` defines the required effective theme, plugins,
extensions, ordered assets, and implementation exclusions. The configuration
validator checks the inherited result; lists in a root configuration replace
inherited lists. Required entries must therefore survive every root override.

Website build output belongs under repository `artifacts/`. The source-layout
validator rejects root HTML, search, sitemap, and Material's hashed runtime
bundles. A product-owned root `assets/` directory may contain scientific
references, fixtures, or authored frontend sources; its name alone does not
identify generated website output. Source verification preserves these inputs.

The configuration projector preserves authored additions and their ordering,
and rejects unsupported shapes before writing either configuration file.

## Configuration and consumer extension points

| Field or extension | Type and default | Allowed values and ownership | Lifecycle and compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `extra.bijux.repository` | Required nonempty string in `mkdocs.yml` | Identifier containing letters, digits, dots, underscores, or hyphens; first character is a letter or digit. Product identity need not be a current registry member. | Read at rendering and navigation binding. Never infer repository identity from a display label. |
| `extra.bijux.nav_mode` | Inherited string `default` | Only `default`; shared shell owns navigation policy. | Validated before rendering; another mode requires an explicit shared contract change. |
| `extra.bijux.theme_key` | Inherited string `bijux:theme` | Only `bijux:theme`; shared palette controller owns the storage record. | Shared across products; private storage signatures and Material indices may change together with the admitted renderer. |
| `extra.bijux.hub_links` | Inherited nonempty ordered list | Each entry has nonempty string `key`, `label`, and an absolute HTTP(S) `url` without credentials or whitespace. Keys are unique; values and order equal `config/hub-links.json`. | Registry changes originate upstream. The root configuration must not duplicate this field. |
| `extra.bijux.repository_facts` | Optional Boolean, default `false` | Explicit `true` enables Material's external repository-facts component. Product chooses the provider use deliberately. Strings and numbers are invalid configuration. | Plain repository navigation and its accessible name remain present when disabled. The template also fails safe for invalid values when rendered outside the validator. |
| `extra.bijux.interactive_report_owner` | Optional canonical relative JSON path, maximum 1024 characters; absent selects no interactive adapter | Authored product configuration owns a committed finite report descriptor. Shared configuration cannot declare product authority. | Explicit `--interactive-report-owner` must equal this value. Passive and interactive renderer selections cannot be mixed. Source/recipe/resource/provider rederivation and publication profile checks remain mandatory; see `security/SECURITY.md`. |
| `hooks` | Optional list of nonempty authored path strings | Product owns hook files and their behavior; MkDocs owns hook loading and existence checks. | Configuration validation checks shape without executing hooks. Existing authored hooks are retained, never silently replaced. |
| Root identity, `nav`, pages, plugin options | MkDocs types and defaults | Product-owned. Required shared capabilities remain present in the effective result. | Normal MkDocs validation and strict production build apply. This shell schema does not invent types for every third-party plugin. |
| `extra_css`, `extra_javascript` | MkDocs ordered lists | Product entries are preserved around the canonical ordered assets. Author script descriptors may retain their module/defer attributes. Canonical script dependencies may not be reordered or made asynchronous. | Projector and effective-assets validator share the ordering contract. Authored CSS is the extension mechanism for authored components. |
| `docs/overrides/partials/site-head.html` | Optional consumer-owned Jinja partial; absent adds nothing | Adds authored head content through the shared root template's `extrahead` block, after `super()`. | Rendered for root and deep pages. Consumer owns syntax and assets; an invalid partial fails the real build. Never replace the shared `scripts` block to add head links. |
| Authored Markdown components | Native Markdown, admitted extensions, and product-owned class names | Content, admonitions, tabs, tables, code, and authored component markup remain product-owned. | Use normal document content and authored styles/scripts; do not copy shared header/navigation runtime to create a product variant. |

Other product fields under `extra` or `extra.bijux` are preserved. An unknown
field does not acquire shared support merely by existing. Unsupported owned
modes, scalar namespaces, duplicate YAML keys, duplicate registry identifiers,
missing registry destinations, and malformed hooks fail with source and field
diagnostics. A `!ENV` value in a shell-owned field must resolve to its declared
type before it is supported; this validator does not execute an arbitrary
environment resolver. Product-owned tagged plugin values remain product-owned.

```yaml
extra:
  bijux:
    repository: bijux-core # authored root identity
    repository_facts: false
```

Navigation mode, theme key, and hub links are inherited from `mkdocs.shared.yml`.
The registry array is the presentation order in the header and complete sidebar.
Parent overview links are destinations; native `details`/`summary` controls only
disclose descendants. Neither control substitutes for the other.

## Public observations and private integration

| Surface | Contract | Ownership and lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-bijux-viewport` on `html` and `body` | Read-only string: `phone`, `normal`, `desktop`, or `wide`. Initial value is computed from viewport width. | Window-owned profile classifier; names describe CSS viewports, not physical devices. CSS remains authoritative for layout. |
| `bijux:viewport-change` on `window` | `CustomEvent.detail`: `{profile, previousProfile, width}`. Profiles use the enum above; initial `previousProfile` is `null`; width is a CSS-pixel number. | Fires when classification changes, including initial classification. Consumers may listen but must not write classifier state; remove consumer listeners on their own document disposal. |
| `bijux:theme-change` on `window` | `detail.mode` is `auto`, `light`, or `dark`; `detail.scheme` is the selected palette option's scheme, defaulting to `default`. | May repeat on mount. In auto mode the selected scheme is not an effective-darkness guarantee; read the resolved `body[data-md-color-scheme]` for painting. Consumer listeners must tolerate repeated notifications and dispose themselves. |
| `--bijux-*` variables declared in `styles/00-tokens.css` | Unregistered CSS token strings; literal base defaults live in `00-tokens.css`, with palette overrides in `01-theme.css`. Valid values must satisfy the consuming CSS property's grammar. | Consumer component styles may consume the token inventory. These are not registered typed properties; invalid overrides follow native CSS fallback and do not receive a contrast guarantee. Meaning changes/removal require consumer analysis and compatibility review. |

Theme event `scroll` metadata, `data-bijux-viewport-source/revision`,
`window.bijuxShell`, `window.bijuxViewportProfile` diagnostic methods, script
functions, `.bijux-*` shell selectors, and control/state `data-bijux-*` attributes
are private integration details. The two read-only observations above do not
make every prefixed attribute a supported product extension hook.

`window.bijuxSearchIndex`, `window.bijuxSearchWorker`, and their status, retry,
cancel, and location events are a private protocol between the admitted Material
adapter and `search-recovery.js`. Index readiness does not imply worker readiness.
Consumers use the named native search control and ordinary result destinations;
they must not write state, inject a second worker, or fabricate an empty corpus.

Material's `document$`, `__md_scope`, `__config`, palette helpers, component IDs,
search protocol, and `data-md-*` selectors are admitted upstream integration
points, not public Bijux APIs. Their source bytes and template boundary are
verified by `tooling/material/build_runtime.py`. An unsupported installed Material version fails when the exact compiler runs;
there is no guessed adapter. The admitted Python Make profile calls that
compiler through its renderer interpreter before destructive cleanup. Schema
validation and source-ownership preflight do not supply that interpreter check:
the standard-library projector does not run the compiler, and other authored
or generic Make entrypoints require their own explicit admission boundary.
Do not infer that every consumer runner is admitted from copied shared files.
See [Material adapter admission](tooling/material/README.md).

## Owned payload accounting

`tooling/quality/performance/payloads.py` reconciles the preferred and retained
compatibility logos, the optional Mermaid library and its retained notices
against an exact committed standard, the canonical `.bijux/docs-projection.json`
and an existing served directory. Run it from the standard checkout:

```sh
python shared/bijux-docs/tooling/quality/performance/payloads.py \
  --repo-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" --site-dir artifacts/site \
  --standard-root "$BIJUX_STD_ROOT" --standard-sha "$BIJUX_STD_SHA" \
  --output artifacts/qualification/payloads.json
```

The preferred PNG must retain its reviewed 128×128 intrinsic dimensions and
the existing 32 KiB ceiling. The tool checks committed/projection/served bytes,
vendor provenance, integrity and retained notices without changing custom
branding or icon fallback. Its report measures local raw file bytes; decoded
response, encoded response and transfer bytes including headers remain unknown
until separately observed. An observed zero is distinct from an unknown value.
This static qualification does not certify cache/compression behavior, physical
sharpness, rendered custom branding, remote acceptance or live delivery.

`tooling/quality/performance/navigation.py` measures exact UTF-8 byte spans for
serialized header, complete primary navigation, local TOC, footer and standalone
tab regions. Tabs enclosed by the canonical header are attributed to that header
once. Duplicate or conflicting owned landmarks refuse accounting. Its input
inventory binds every shared template, the selected configuration and every
served HTML route to exact fingerprints; missing/stale inputs and navigation
links to missing or 404 routes fail. Normal routes and the root 404 representation
are reported separately, including normal routes outside the authored tree.

```sh
python shared/bijux-docs/tooling/quality/performance/navigation.py \
  --repo-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" --site-dir artifacts/site \
  --config artifacts/mkdocs.yml --manifest artifacts/navigation-inputs.json \
  --standard-root "$BIJUX_STD_ROOT" --standard-sha "$BIJUX_STD_SHA" \
  --output artifacts/qualification/navigation-payloads.json
```

The version-one input object contains `source` (the selected origin/full commit,
tree and authority returned by the source reader), `configuration` (owned path,
bytes and SHA-256), `producer_inputs` (every committed `partials/*.html`, including
nested partials, mapped to an owned projected path/bytes/SHA-256), `html_files`
(the complete served relative HTML path to bytes/SHA-256 inventory), and explicit
`retained_generation` scope/provenance. Historical generator/runtime evidence
remains historical even when selected template bytes match. Material function-name
YAML tags are read as inert metadata; executable object tags are refused. This
measurement does not replace canonical generation or the full public-route
validator. Raw repetition does not establish compressed delivery, cache, CPU or
optimization savings, and the report prescribes no unmeasured reduction target.

## Shared ownership and verification

Every row has one behavior producer. Product configuration/content and Material
base templates are inputs to that producer, not competing controllers.

| Shared surface | Producer and consumer boundary | Executable verifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `partials/main.html` | Compiler owns the admitted runtime script replacement; Material owns `base.html` layout; consumer optionally owns `partials/site-head.html`. | `generated/test_material_runtime.py`, `generated/test_template_extensions.py`, source projection tests |
| `partials/header.html` | Shared header/control markup consumes product identity and the canonical registry. Material supplies icons/palette markup. | Generated shell journeys; navigation projection fixtures |
| `partials/nav.html`, `partials/nav-item.html` | Shared complete recursive native tree consumes MkDocs `nav` and page state. | Generated overview/disclosure/current-page/all-registry journeys |
| `partials/bijux-nav.html` | Shared template macros normalize paths and derive labels from authored navigation. | Navigation projection fixtures and generated deep-document journeys |
| `partials/search.html` | Shared presentation names the current configured site and escapes its authored name. Material owns the native form, result list, options and provider interface; the shared transport/recovery owners below own enhancement and failure state. | `generated/test_search_scope.py`, search-scope browser gate |
| `partials/source.html` | Shared privacy gate wraps Material's repository navigation; product owns repository identity and explicit facts choice. | `generated/test_repository_facts.py`, repository browser gate |
| `partials/logo.html` | Shared brand renderer consumes baseline-owned asset; product supplies site name. | Branding and generated phone shell journeys |
| `partials/footer.html`, `partials/footer-profile-links.html` | Shared footer renders MkDocs previous/next destinations and shared profile links. | Rendered template fixtures and full artifact link validation; visual/assistive review remains separate |
| `partials/javascripts/base.html`, `partials/javascripts/palette.html` | Shared bounded-storage compatibility for admitted Material helpers and early palette application. | Palette unit tests and preferences browser gate |
| `theme-persistence.js` | Shared palette persistence consumes authored native palette options; Material retains visual theme semantics. | Palette units and preferences browser gate |
| `viewport-profile.js` | Shared window profile classifier emits read-only observations. | Viewport source tests and generated responsive-boundary journeys |
| `nav-state.js`, `detail-tabs.js` | Shared active-path and header-detail state consumes server-rendered destinations. | Navigation projection and deep-page/history journeys |
| `nav-reveal.js` | Shared container scroll reveal and named desktop registry overflow actions consume active navigation state; the coordinator owns their document lifetime. | Registry lifecycle units and generated desktop/resize/navigation journeys; compatibility aliases retained |
| `content-reflow.js` | Shared progressive annotation of measured code/table overflow; authored source, line anchors, cells, labels and controls remain owned by their authors. | `unit/content-reflow.test.cjs`; `ui/generated-specs/reader-reflow.spec.js` via `ui-test-reader` |
| `external-links.js` | Shared progressive warnings and explicit `_blank` opener isolation; products own href, target, download and referrer intent. The coordinator owns mount/disposal. | `ui/generated-specs/external-links.spec.js` via `ui-test-link-policy`; `tests/test_docs_external_link_projection.py` |
| `bootstrap.js` | Shared document-lifetime coordinator owns control upgrade, compact drawer/search interaction, binding and disposal. | Search focus/input units; generated shell/drawer/search journeys |
| `search-recovery.js`, `tooling/material/search-*-adapter.js` | Shared failure UI and admitted index/worker transport; Material worker retains tokenization, ranking, options, and result protocol. | Index/worker/recovery units; search outage/retry/latest-query browser gate |
| `mermaid-init.js` | Shared sole renderer; lazy admitted vendor renders strictly from preserved authored source. Material must not intercept source fences. | Renderer/dependency units and diagrams browser gate |
| `nav-sync.js` | Shared compatibility entrypoint delegates to the coordinator; it is not another navigation owner. | Generated baseline asset admission and shell journeys |
| `00-tokens.css`, `01-theme.css` | Shared design tokens and palette variables. | Preferences and rendered contrast probes; manual visual review |
| `02-layout.css`, `03-header.css`, `04-nav.css` | Shared page, header, and complete navigation presentation. | Responsive shell/header/drawer journeys |
| `05-content.css`, `06-components.css` | Shared native document and component presentation; product content remains authored. | Rich-content/reflow fixtures and rendered content probes |
| `07-utilities.css`, `08-responsive.css` | Shared hidden/focus semantics and breakpoint overrides. | Hidden-strip, keyboard, resize, and occluded-target journeys |
| `styles/extra.css` | Shared ordered CSS import manifest; no independent component rules. | Artifact CSS import validation and style source contracts |
| `config/`, `tooling/configuration/`, projection and quality tooling | Shared registry, baseline, source admission, owned asset ordering, generated ownership and validation. | Configuration, source projection, compiler, and schema tests |

Test paths in this table are relative to `tests/bijux-docs/` unless prefixed by
`tests/` in the executable trace. `config/shell-contract-trace.json` lists exact
source and executable test references for public behavior and boundary guards.
It records applicability, not a universal pass or full accessibility claim.

The shared external-link producer supplies the required
`assets/javascripts/external-links.js` asset. It is projected at that exact path
and executes before the coordinator. Native `href`, `target`, `download`,
`referrerpolicy` and relationship intent remain authored inputs; offsite origin
alone does not select a new window. Explicit `_blank` adds `noopener`, retaining
other relationship/privacy tokens and removing contradictory `opener`.

The projector does not claim existing authored external-link files as legacy
managed content. Each consumer must review its current file and authored link
intent, then explicitly migrate that authored boundary in the same coherent
candidate that adopts the generated producer. There is no force-adoption alias
or silent ownership rewrite. Authored target/content decisions are separate
from generated synchronization where separable. An existing consumer's blanket
new-tab script must not execute alongside this producer.

Native anchors keep modified clicks, browser menus and Back/Forward. The shared
script has no click listener, window-opening call, router or history owner. Its
private document annotations and observer are disposed by the existing signal.
Plain actions have warning text; icon actions have visible/accessible indication.
Consumers retain authored source warnings/security for no-script use, and review
named-window/opener integrations rather than imposing `_blank` on them.
Cross-origin download delivery remains dependent on browser/server policy;
authored filename preservation is not proof of that external capability.

## Lifetimes and compatibility

The coordinator creates an `AbortController` per document mount and aborts the
previous lifetime before rebinding. Compact drawer modality owns temporary
background inertness, focus containment, Escape/restoration, and close-on-resize;
dispose restores previous values. Desktop navigation uses ordinary destination
anchors. Material instant navigation and ordinary full loads both remain valid.
An overflowing desktop site registry exposes named backward/forward actions
with at least 44 px targets. They scroll the owning list without changing
destinations; ordinary Tab reveals the complete focused link. Boundary actions
remain focusable with accurate `aria-disabled` state. Resize hands focus to a
visible current link or compact drawer control. Aborting the enhancement hides
its actions and restores the native scrolling list.
Bindings apply to their declared component owner. The shared drawer applies
to the Bijux header and navigation markup; it does not require an unrelated
Material-native header to expose Bijux readiness attributes or replace its
native control. Owned enhancement readiness is a private mount result, not
Material's window-level JavaScript class. Failed or aborted enhancement must
restore temporary state so the native authored fallback remains operable.
Native search fields and result destinations retain Material semantics even
when an owned recovery bridge is present. Global character-only `/`, `f` and `s`
search shortcuts are disabled in both headers. Readers open search through its
named button or native inline field; focused query input, native Arrow/Enter
result navigation, Escape restoration and browser modifier defaults remain available.

Global profile/storage listeners bind once per window. Index and worker owners
retain their bounded window transport; pagehide cancels owned work and bfcache
restoration reestablishes the appropriate binding. No generic global error
suppression or global network API replacement belongs to this shell.

Authored anchors and the complete native disclosure tree are rendered without
JavaScript. Enhanced controls must retain a usable fallback when enhancement is
unavailable. This architecture statement does not certify every no-script
keyboard interaction; the generated fallback gate and browser-specific input
protocol remain acceptance requirements.

Compatibility names `runPhoneNavigationSync`, `bindMobileDrawerReveal`,
`nav-sync.js`, the `validate_shell_contract.py` wrapper, and course-strip selectors
remain until exact consumer source/configuration analysis proves retirement is
safe. They do not justify adding a second scoped navigation tree. New public
hooks are additive only after typed fixtures and compatibility review; changing
or removing a hook requires producer and consumer qualification against the
same accepted source reference.

## Architecture decision: retain MkDocs and Material

The admitted architecture keeps server-rendered Markdown and native links,
Material content/search features, and bounded progressive enhancement. This
serves existing Python and Rust documentation producers without introducing a
second route, content, or search framework. Reimplementing the site as an app
framework would add a parallel owner for these working capabilities; it requires
an explicit decision with measured user benefit and a migration/rollback plan.

The compatibility cost is deliberate: Material 9.7.7 distribution, base template,
source map, and worker are admitted by exact digests; owned transformations fail
on drift. The index and worker adapters own transport/lifecycle, while the native
worker algorithm remains unchanged. Mermaid source fences use the custom class
`bijux-diagram` and the baseline-owned lazy vendor; eager legacy vendor loading
or `pre.mermaid` source fences would create competing renderers and are rejected.
Theme storage uses the fixed cross-project key and admitted native palette index.

Unsupported combinations include an unadmitted Material bundle, a replaced
shared scripts block, duplicated shared navigation runtime, asynchronous owned
dependency scripts, and treating a clean authored root template as generated
without explicit adoption. Consumer-specific plugin configuration and authored
head/component assets are retained through their named extension points.

Adopt upstream schema/template/runtime changes as a coherent accepted source
unit, then refresh managed shared files and projected destinations. An authored
root template first extracts its head additions to `partials/site-head.html`
while its old root template includes that partial, preserving the rendered head.
Replacing the root with the shared template requires explicit reviewed adoption
and all admitted assets/configuration together; the projector never silently
claims authored ownership. Roll back using the previous complete accepted
source, ownership record, configuration, and asset set. Preserve the authored
head/content and verify the resulting native capabilities; do not mix a new
template with a retired runtime asset.

Projection provenance, protected destinations, exact-source verification, and
implementation exclusions are specified in [consumer projection](README.md).
The shared asset inventory and versions are authoritative in the baseline and
compiler provenance, rather than repeated vendor URLs in this document.


## Stylesheet declaration ownership

Material's admitted `base.html` loads its main stylesheet, palette stylesheet
when configured, and then `extra_css` in effective configuration order. The
canonical `styles/extra.css` imports tokens, theme, layout, header, navigation,
content, components, utilities and responsive adaptations in that order.
Consumer additions retain their declared position around the canonical asset;
an authored root list replaces the inherited list. Additional consumer styles
do not acquire ownership of private shell display, drawer or hidden states.

The source-owned `import_graph` admits `extra.css` as its ordered entry, using
the canonical unconditional local `url("./domain.css")` spelling for the nine
listed domain sheets. Those sheets are leaves. The guard records every entry
edge and the entry/domain source digests, then refuses any parsed import in a
domain sheet before qualifying declarations. This includes local, remote,
conditional, duplicate and cyclic edges: an imported sheet could otherwise
hide priorities or resources outside the inventory. No undeclared destination
is read or fetched. Case, escaped keywords and comment boundaries cannot open
a domain leaf; import text in comments or quoted declarations remains inert.
Selected entry/domain files must remain regular owned files without linked
path components. A future nested graph needs a separate finite ownership
decision; unsupported policy modes cannot silently grant traversal.

This boundary concerns the canonical shared graph. It does not scan arbitrary
additional files or ban declared consumer `extra_css`. Consumer extensions and
their effective load order, resources and competing states retain their own
authored qualification duties.

The admitted Material and shared rules use an unlayered cascade. The policy's
`layer_strategy` binds that choice to `bijux-std` with its precedence rationale;
it is not an allowance for arbitrary named layers. Shared domain styles may
not introduce named or anonymous `@layer` blocks, ordering statements or nested
layer rules. Moving the existing component sheet into a layer makes its normal
footer grid lose to Material's unlayered flex declaration, even when shared CSS
loads later. A layered strategy therefore requires a separate architecture
decision covering Material, shared and consumer precedence, with native
evidence; editing the policy to an unsupported mode cannot silently enable it.

[`config/cascade-contract.json`](config/cascade-contract.json) records the exact
shared declaration exceptions. Each priority exception identifies its file,
conditional ancestry, selector list, property and value, with owner, reason and
necessity status. Duplicate fallback exceptions additionally preserve value
order. Existing `vh` followed by `dvh` declarations retain engines without
dynamic viewport units; this is not permission for arbitrary repeated properties.

| Existing exception | Intent and remaining evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Dark diagram paint in `01-theme.css` | Integrates with emitted Mermaid SVG rules. Static source inventory does not qualify every diagram class's contrast or prove every priority necessary. |
| Footer grid, transparent surface and directional margins in `06-components.css` | Use normal declarations. The canonical shared stylesheet follows Material: `.md-footer__inner.bijux-footer-nav` ties the admitted `.md-footer__inner:not([hidden])` specificity and wins by source order; scoped previous/next margins outrank Material's directional rules. Computed footer controls preserve grid, transparent paint and zero directional margins in the existing light/dark reader journeys. Removing the shared grid declaration exposes Material flex. These rules require the canonical load order and do not grant consumers ownership of private shell display. |
| Hidden and accessible-name geometry in `07-utilities.css` | Preserve the accepted unconditional hidden-state rule, its `until-found` distinction and offscreen label geometry. The policy cannot waive `display:none!important`. |
| Conditional navigation presentation in `08-responsive.css` | Retain one exposed presentation and native fallback under the admitted viewport/readiness conditions. Cross-rule competition remains a rendered behavior duty. |
| Reduced-motion duration/count in `08-responsive.css` | Reader preference takes precedence over component animation declarations. Native platform and assistive evaluation remains separate. |

The declaration guard parses actual source using the already pinned Stylis
parser from the diagram toolchain. It verifies installed diagram manifest/lock
and parser source provenance before import; it does not install dependencies.
An existing qualified build may be selected explicitly:

```sh
BIJUX_DIAGRAM_DEPENDENCIES=artifacts/website-security/dependencies/build \
  node shared/bijux-docs/tooling/quality/styles/cascade.mjs
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_docs_cascade_contract.py -v
```

The second command uses the same environment selection when it is exported.
Diagnostics include parsed declaration source-end line/column, selector,
conditional ancestry, property and conflicting values. Unknown priorities,
unreviewed same-block duplicates, stale exception records, missing imported
styles and changed parser ownership fail. Case, comments and escaped priority
identifiers cannot bypass the guard; quoted text is not interpreted as priority.
Layer diagnostics retain file, conditional ancestry, parsed rule value and
source-end location. Case and escaped layer keywords are recognized on parsed
at-rules; layer text inside comments or quoted declarations remains inert.

[`config/style-tokens.json`](config/style-tokens.json) records the existing
`--bijux-*` vocabulary. Each name has a concrete purpose, description, consumer
override boundary and exact CSS definition bindings: file, conditional ancestry,
selectors, value, role and reason. The guard derives declarations and reference
uses from the admitted parser; it does not invent missing type, spacing or motion
tokens. Current bindings cover root defaults, Material palette selectors,
responsive shell measure and the light focus indicator on saturated shell
surfaces. Unknown definitions, unreviewed value/scope changes, repeated or stale
bindings, unsupported purposes and expanded owner/override permissions fail.

Consumer content may consume the inventory. A theme extension must preserve
content/surface/shadow meanings and qualify its relevant contrast and interaction
states. Shell measures permit qualified content growth, rather than private
drawer/header replacement. Shared shell focus paint retains its scoped owner;
an exception requires explicit keyboard evidence. The guard qualifies shared
definition scopes, not arbitrary consumer overrides or their human approval.

Parsed value functions identify case-sensitive references, including escaped
identifiers and nested fallbacks. An unknown name in the reserved Bijux family
requires a nonempty explicit fallback; every nested fallback reference is also
checked. Such a fallback permits an optional consumer extension without adding
an unreviewed shared definition. Empty fallback text cannot rescue an unknown
name. Quoted/commented reference text and quoted URL payloads remain inert.
Malformed arguments and more than 64 nested component groups or 1,024 references
per value fail. Definition cycles, including self-reference with fallback, are
refused within an exact conditional/selector scope; this does not model all
native inheritance or overlapping selector combinations.

Material's `--md-*` variables remain external CSS/runtime ownership. The registry
binds its runtime examples to the admitted runtime provenance and actual literal
tooltip/indicator setters. Shared palette declarations adapt selected colors;
merely consumed properties such as `--md-header-height` with its `3rem` fallback
are not claimed as shared CSS definitions. Other consumer variable namespaces
retain their authored ownership. These are unregistered CSS strings: reference
integrity and meaningful source purposes do not prove consuming value grammar,
native inheritance, theme/forced-color contrast or arbitrary override safety.

This is a bounded ordered import graph, unlayered strategy and declaration
policy, not a general CSS validity or selector specificity checker. It does
not certify computed Material/shared/consumer precedence, authored consumer
import/resource graphs, complete token purposes/override scopes, competing state rules,
responsive media/attribute agreement, or light/dark/forced-color behavior.
Those source, rendered, consumer, manual and live duties retain their own
verification; a source guard must not weaken existing hidden/focus tests.

## Reader history and optional scroll tracking

The shared baseline preserves native authored fragment destinations and browser
Back/Forward. It retains Material instant navigation, active table-of-contents
indication and `toc.follow`. It does not enable `navigation.tracking` by default:
that feature replaces the current URL fragment from scroll position and can
restore a fragment after browser Back while the document is still settling.

A product may explicitly add `navigation.tracking` to its authored feature list.
The projector preserves authored feature additions; synchronization does not
silently strip this opt-in. Such a product owns compatibility qualification for
ordinary fragment Back/Forward, instant reader return, and URL stability during
scroll restoration in every admitted browser. Automatic tracking must not be
presented as qualified by the shared default history receipt. When reviewing an
existing consumer override, distinguish an intentional opt-in from a feature
copied from the previous standard before changing that authored list.

When an inherited `mkdocs.shared.yml` still contains a previous standard's
`navigation.tracking`, changing the accepted standard pin alone does not remove
that feature: the projector preserves configured theme feature lists. Select the
product's reader policy explicitly in its authored `mkdocs.yml`. A root
`theme.features` list replaces the inherited list under MkDocs configuration
inheritance; it does not append to it. To select stable native reader URLs, list
all current `theme.required_features` from `mkdocs-baseline.json` without
`navigation.tracking`, retaining any other deliberately authored optional
features. Keep `theme.custom_dir` and other product theme settings intact. Review
the resulting effective feature list after every accepted standard change, and
run the shared contract validator to catch missing required features.

This is an authored configuration choice, not a managed-file exception. Do not
infer feature ownership from a matching old default or silently strip a
product's deliberate tracking opt-in. Qualification must check the exact URL at
the trusted link activation, then browser Back/Forward and its settling window;
retained visible reading context alone cannot certify URL preservation. See
[MkDocs configuration inheritance](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#configuration-inheritance)
and [Material anchor tracking](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#anchor-tracking)
for the supported configuration semantics.
